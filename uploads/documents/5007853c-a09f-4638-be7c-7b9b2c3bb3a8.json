While it suggests\nthat the CTO should primarily focus on driving business\ngrowth through technology, this perspective may not\nfully capture the nuanced realities faced by technology\nleaders in various industries. The effective integration of\ntechnical innovation with broader organizational\nstrategies often involves navigating conflicting interests,\nstakeholder expectations, and rapidly changing market\ndynamics, which can be more challenging than the\nchapter implies.
